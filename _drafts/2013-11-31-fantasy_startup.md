A few months ago I joined a fantasy football league with a few friends from 
college. It was done mostly on a whim, with a little bit of encouragement
from having watched too many episodes of [The League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League)
in one sitting on Netflix. Needless to say, I've been pleasently surprised
with how enjoyable the whole thing has been.

I've recently been playing around with docker quite a bit and have really been liking it. It's
both extremely powerful and extremely easy to use, which are two things that make me take a
liking to a porject. I've found myself repeatedly visiting the 
[installation instructions](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/ubuntulinux/) as I've
set up a few different environments. I figured I'd toss together a few scripts and host them
on this site so that I could just `curl` in the scripts and run them.

These scripts will install docker and download the base docker image. I'm currently only hosting
scripts for Ubuntu, as that is what I've been playing around with, but I'd be more than happy
to host scripts for other distributions as well. Feel free to fork [this blog](https://github.com/brianbrunner/brianbrunner.github.io),
add your scripts, and send a pull request.


Also, I do want to stress that running scripts straight off of some random dude's blog is
generally a _pretty bad idea_ as far as security is concerned. I personally don't plan on 
trying anything funny, but nonetheless it's always best to at least download a script and
read over it before you run it.

Ubuntu 12.04
------------

Because installing docker requires a restart in `12.04`, this install is divided into two 
scripts. First you'll run this command. _Note that this will reboot your machine_.

    /bin/sh <(curl -s http://brianbrunner.com/shell/docker/ubuntu/12.04/install_1.sh) 

After the restart, you'll run the next command.

    /bin/sh <(curl -s http://brianbrunner.com/shell/docker/ubuntu/12.04/install_2.sh)

Ubuntu 13.04
------------

This is just a one step install. You'll only need to run the following command:

    /bin/sh <(curl -s http://brianbrunner.com/shell/docker/ubuntu/13.04/install.sh)

Testing It Out
--------------

You can run an interactive shell in a container using the base `ubuntu` image with the command:

    sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

And that's all there is to getting docker set up. I really hope that you'll check out docker if you haven't
already. It is really quite a cool piece of tech.

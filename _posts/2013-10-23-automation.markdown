Recently, an email thread got started on the all-team mailing list at my
office. Everyone in the company, devs and non-devs alike, was asked to
take stock of all the different SaaS products that they were using. When
all was said and done, the list that we had compiled numbered around 40
different websites, most of which we pay some monthly fee for.

This was a little bit of a surprise for me, as we're a team of less than 
20. This means that we use twice as many SaaS products as we have people. 
If you want to unbundle all of the different services we use that fall
under the umbrella of AWS, that number jumps from around 40 to more than
50. Basically, we leverage the crap out of other people's software.

Incidentally, most of the software we pay for on the engineering side of
things has open-source equivalents that we could run ourselves. We were 
recently looking to put together an automated testing setup for our frontend 
code, and one of our engineers offered to set up [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) 
to take care of it. It took all of a minute to decide on a managed, paid
alternative instead. Because it was, without a doubt, much cheaper.

When it comes down to it, all employees, especially software engineers, are 
fucking expensive. In my experience, salaries are almsot always the biggest
expense for a technology startup.  When you have the choice between having 
someone spend time setting up a piece of software or just paying a company 
to do it for you, you should almost always go for the outside solution.
This is especially true when you're organization is still small, as time 
spent managing and self-hosted solution would be better spent building out
your core  product.

Using outside software even when you could do it yourself is something that
I've found comes naturally to those in more business oriented roles. 
Engineers are, however, notoriuos for reinventing things that are already

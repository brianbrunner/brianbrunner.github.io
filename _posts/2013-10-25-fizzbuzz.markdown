Software engineering interviews are a very open-ended art form. Every company
puts their own particular spin on things so that they can figure out whether
or not a candidate is both qualified and a good fit for their team. But there 
is one thing that I strongly believe every single company should do when
interviewing: **ask FizzBuzz.**

Just to be clear, I don't literally mean that you should ask the specific FizzBuzz
problem. You can ask any sort of basic problem you want. Count the number of words
in a sentence that start and end with the same letter. Calulate the 
[Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between
two words. And so on. The point is to figure out whether or not someone can actually 
code.

Don't give a candidate a day long programming assignment. Don't try and bring
them on as a contractor for a short stint. Don't do a code review of a repo on 
their github. Don't do much of anything until you've established that they can 
solve a trivial problem without any sort of fuss.

This was all brought up last night when a friend of mine asked for advice on how
to conduct a technical interview. I suggested a FizzBuzz type problem (among other
things) and he was in a small state of disbelief that something so simple was a
necessary question to ask. I reassured him that, yes, it was necessary, as I have
seen people flounder on questions like these.

A solid answer to FizzBuzz is like a firm handshake when meeting your new boss. 
It's like opening the door for your date. It's an introduction that sets a 
minimum bar and guarantees that neither the interviewer nor the candidate is 
wasting the other's time.

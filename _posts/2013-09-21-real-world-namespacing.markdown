I spent this past weekend in Stowe, Vermont, as an impostor in a room that didn't belong to me. 
Well, technically, it didn't belong to my fiance, so I guess she was the impostor.

We got to our hotel at around 11PM and found what we thought were the keys to our room in an
envelope sitting outside the front desk. The envelope had my fiance's last name, Lynch, on it.
